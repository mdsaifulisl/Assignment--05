### Project Description
This is a complete Contact Management Application built using **React JS**.  
The app uses **Context API** for global state management and **json-server** for backend simulation during development.  

> ⚠️ **Note:** The `json-server` backend is **not running** on the live Netlify deployment, because Netlify only hosts static sites.  
> All API calls in the live version are therefore non-functional. To fully use the CRUD functionality, run the project locally with `json-server`.

#### Features:
- Display all contacts in a table on the Home page
- Add new contact using a separate page
- Show contact details in a modal
- Edit contact information in a modal
- Delete contact with confirmation
- Search contacts by first name, last name, email, or phone
- Filter contacts by First Name (A → Z), Last Name (A → Z), or Oldest to Newest
- Responsive design using Bootstrap and custom CSS
- Display "No Contact Information" when no data is found

#### Technologies Used:
- React JS
- Context API (for global state management)
- json-server (for backend API simulation in local development)
- Bootstrap 5
- CSS / Flexbox
