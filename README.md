### Project Description
This is a complete Contact Management Application built using **React JS**.  
The app uses **Context API** for global state management and a custom **Express.js backend** for persistent storage and full CRUD functionality.

#### Features:

- Add new contact using a separate page
- Show contact details in a modal
- Edit contact information in a modal
- Delete contact with confirmation
- Search contacts by first name, last name, email, or phone
- Filter contacts by First Name (A → Z), Last Name (A → Z), or Oldest to Newest
- Responsive design using Bootstrap and custom CSS
- Display "No Contact Information" when no data is found
- Fully functional backend with persistent storage for add, edit, and delete

#### Technologies Used:
- React JS
- Context API (for global state management)
- Express.js (for backend API)
